      This band is so much fun! I mean, just look at those frilly socks.

    <h2>My history with Gogol Bordello</h2>
    <p>
      The first time I heard anything by Gogol Bordello was when I listened to their Tiny Desk Concert at NPR.
      My boyfriend at the time, now husband, had suggested that I check them out, and I'm so glad he did. 
      I was instantly intrigued and knew I had to hear more.

      I've seen them live in concert twice, and let me tell you, their shows are quite the party.
      The energy is intense and incredibly fun. No other band I've seen compares. Check to see if they're playing near you anytime soon. <a href="https://gogolbordello.shop.ticketstoday.com/" target="_blank">Check for tickets.</a>
      I heartily recommend them.
